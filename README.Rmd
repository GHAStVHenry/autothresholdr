```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

## Installation
First you need to install the R package `rJava`. To do this, you'll need to have Java jdk installed, so have a google of "install java jdk" for whichever operating system you have and follow the instructions to install it. Then run 
```{r Install rJava, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rJava")
```
If this doesn't work, there are plenty of posts on how to troubleshoot installation of `rJava`, bt you'll need to get this done before you can go on. I've previously encountered insurmountable problems while trying to install rJava on 32-bit systems. 

Having installed `rJava`, run
```{r Install autothresholdr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rorynolan/autothresholdr")
```
and you're done!
